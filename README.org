#+title: Readme

* Issue
Mito seems to be causing a memory corruption problem when I package the application as a binary executable.  Everything works fine in an interactive setting and I only see this when running the binary SBCL makes.

I have tried both (asdf:make) and (sb-ext:save-lisp-and-die) to make binaries, but I get the same issue with both

* Recreating the bug
Build the application
#+begin_src shell
git clone https://github.com/garlic0x1/mito-error-poc.git
cd mito-error-poc
make install
#+end_src

Now you should have `mito-error-poc` executable in your path (makefile uses ~/.local/bin)

Running the executable:

#+begin_src
~> mito-error-poc

* Update
The issue seems to be in the cl-dbi package, as using that alone causes the same problem
